# hmlr

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build assets for production with minification
npm run build

# build assets for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run a local server with the built production assets
npm start

For full blown production running, just serve the contents of /dist over a normal http server. Make sure to build the assets first!
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
